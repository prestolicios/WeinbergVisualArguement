My goal for this visual arguement is just to spread awareness of how addictive opiates can be.
This is not just for those who are considering using opiates recreationally, but also for those who have been prescribed opiates to be 
careful of the addictive nature of these drugs. This is a work in progress and im not sure its the direction I will end with,
but I think the message to be careful with opiates is getting across.
